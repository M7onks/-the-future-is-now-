Ressources
I obviously heavily relied on some of the code of the Code Institut's "Love Running" project.
Also I would like thank my Mentor Sheryl and the Tutor Support team for their patience and for providing excellent help.
Also, I found a website called w3school (https://www.w3schools.com/), which was able to answer a very important question.
And finally, I also sometimes referred to a book called "HTML & CSS for dumies".


Testing
Iused the W3 HTML validator, well as the W3 CSS validator (Jigsaw)
While Jigsaw returned no errors, the html check resulted in a few. However most of these  referenced to code samples which I used (and quoted). Since the codee was
working, I did not want to edit this code.

I used Chrome, Firefox and Opera, which all worked fine.

I tested on a desktop, a laptop, a tablet and a Smartphone (FHD+) and found no problems apart from those mentioned above.


Functionality
Each page contains 4 links to the 4 sections of the website (collapses to dropdown on smaller devices). These links are located in the head, on the the left.
Also, if you click on the "The future is now" text, you will return to the homepage.
On the bottom you will find 4 dummy social media links.
