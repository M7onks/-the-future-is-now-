About
The idea behind this project is to get the general public up to date with the possibilies and possible threats modern technologies are capable off, since there's a lot people seem to think that their new mobile, which includes a 5MP better camera is cutting edge.
This should be presented in a that little to non previous knowledge of the topics covered is required

Potential user's expectations and perspective


Difficulties
I honestly must mention, that I consider Code Anywhere as well as gitpod as the worst IDEs I have ever encounter (and I've programmed Motorola 68k Assembler, some 20 years ago)
I do not want to rant too much about that, but what discouraged me the most was previewing my work. E.g. the footer worked fine in the index.html, so I copied the script to
the other two HTML files, expecting the same thing. But not only did it not show up on these two pages, it also disappered on the preview of the index file (?)
Since you want check your code often, [python3 -m http.server] is far to long and their should a shortcut for that.
Addionally I tested the preview function by addind random text on an HTML file, but although I saved every file, addded and pushed and did a hard reset in Chrome the changes werre not shown. Again, honestly I do not know what to think of that. It made it really hard for to see if my code was correct or not.


Known bugs


Ressources
I obviously heavily relied on some of the code of the Code Institut's "Love Running" project.
Also I would like thank my Mentor Sheryl and the Tutor Support team for their patience and for providing excellent help.
Also, I found a website called w3school (https://www.w3schools.com/), which was able to answer some of my questions.


Things I think I did well


Possible improvements
I think the most obvious improvement would be to make the site ressponsive.
If I had more time, I would also include articles with the possibillity to comment on said articles.
