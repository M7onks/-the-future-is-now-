About
The idea behind this project is to get the general public up to date with the possibilies and possible threats modern technologies are capable off, since there's a lot people seem to think that their new mobile, which includes a 5MP better camera is cutting edge.
This should be presented in a that little to non previous knowledge of the topics covered is required

Potential user's expectations and perspective (User Story)
"As a member of the general public, I would like to see what current technology is capable of"

Difficulties



Known bugs


Ressources
I obviously heavily relied on some of the code of the Code Institut's "Love Running" project.
Also I would like thank my Mentor Sheryl and the Tutor Support team for their patience and for providing excellent help.
Also, I found a website called w3school (https://www.w3schools.com/), which was able to answer some of my questions.
And finally, I also sometimes referred to a book called "HTML & CSS for dumies".


Things I think I did well




Possible improvements / mistakes
I think the most obvious improvement would be to make the site ressponsive.
If I had more time, I would also include articles with the possibillity to comment on said articles.



Testing
